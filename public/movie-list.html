<h1>The Best Movies According to Richard</h1>
<h2>My Favourite Movies</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Menu</h3>
<p>Thriller with a tad bit of mystery, and unironically not so great when you have a big appetite.</p>
<h3>Edge Of Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Groundhog Day scenarios are always fun watches to me.
    Especially when combined with amazing fight scenes, and the awesome mecha suits the soldiers are given to fight with.
<h3>Captain America: The First Avenger</h3>
<p>Underdog, Steve Rodgers, is a scrawny guy that eventually shows how a good person is all you need to be to make a difference... along with a massive steroid boost
    designed to turn humans into super soldiers. But to be fair it was only given to him to make sure a good person was going to be using it.</p>
